# daily-planner-
A simple daily calendar page where you can save events thorugh out hours of the day. 
The user has the time frame from 9am-5am to log daily events. 
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jquery, to style the page's colums and to display the planner and saves information into the local storage.
